<h1>Devil and Angel</h1>

<hr />

<p><br>
Meet and fall in love with simplification</p>

<p>God only gave one day</p>

<p>You fell like an angel</p>

<p>I got heart disease</p>

<p>I dare not look more</p>

<p>I know you are beautiful far away</p>

<p>So no longer let the initiative to add more</p>

<p>Always stand in the</p>

<p>Another line where you&rsquo;re not</p>

<p>With a few hard to say</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like waiting for a love of departure</p>

<p>Sorry to a little</p>

<p>Again a bit</p>

<p>unawares</p>

<p>The smell of proximity seems clear</p>

<p>I see your faith</p>

<p>And everything about you</p>

<p>I start hallucinations</p>

<p>Imagine your day</p>

<p>Think that love can escape the boundary between hell and heaven</p>

<p>t&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m not awake yet</p>

<p>I can hear you say goodbye</p>

<p>hindsight</p>

<p>You have god&rsquo;s love in your arms</p>

<p>But I am in an immense penal sea</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;ll be better off at least</p>

<p>So secret love is still secret love</p>

<p>I am waiting for the departure soon</p>

<p>And decided not to say goodbye.</p>
