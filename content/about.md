<h1>Devil and Angel</h1>

----
<br>
Meet and fall in love with simplification

God only gave one day

You fell like an angel

I got heart disease

I dare not look more

I know you are beautiful far away

So no longer let the initiative to add more

Always stand in the

Another line where you're not

With a few hard to say

It's like waiting for a love of departure

Sorry to a little

Again a bit

unawares

The smell of proximity seems clear

I see your faith

And everything about you

I start hallucinations

Imagine your day

Think that love can escape the boundary between hell and heaven

t's just that I'm not awake yet

I can hear you say goodbye

hindsight

You have god's love in your arms

But I am in an immense penal sea

I think you'll be better off at least

So secret love is still secret love

I am waiting for the departure soon

And decided not to say goodbye.
